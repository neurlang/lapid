# 🔥 Lapid

**Fast ML inference on every device. Pure Rust.**

## Highlights

- 📦 **Just `cargo add`**: builds anywhere with plain Rust; GPU drivers are picked up at runtime.
- 🛠️ **Hackable**: models and GPU kernels are plain, readable code you can change.
- 🖥️ **Every GPU**: CUDA, Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU, with a fast CPU fallback.
- 🤗 **Hugging Face and GGUF**: load models straight from the Hub or a `.gguf` file.

## Why

| | In short |
|---|---|
| **ONNX Runtime** | Fast on NVIDIA, slow on other GPUs, big and hard to change |
| **llama.cpp** | Fast, but you need a different build for each GPU |
| **candle** | Supports few GPUs |
| **burn** | Made for training |
| **tract** | Runs only on CPU |
| **lapid** | One small Rust library, fast on every GPU, and you can read and change all of it |

## Quick start

```sh
cargo add lapid
```

```rust
use lapid::{Device, Tensor};

let x = Tensor::from_f32(&[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], &[2, 2])?;
let y = x.matmul(&x)?.gelu()?.softmax()?;          // builds a graph
println!("{:?}", Device::best().to_vec_f32(&y)?);  // compiles, fuses, runs
```
